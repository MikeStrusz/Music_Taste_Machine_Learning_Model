# Music Taste Prediction Model: New Music Friday Recommender üíøüéßüëçüëé

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict my music taste based on my liked songs, recently loved albums, and albums I didn't enjoy. The model is trained using regression and recommends albums from Spotify's "New Music Friday" playlist. It incorporates features like artist centrality, genre encoding, mood scores, and energy profiles to make personalized recommendations.

## Project Overview

Hi, I'm Mike Strusz! üëã  
I'm a Data Analyst based in Milwaukee, passionate about solving real-world problems through data-driven insights. With a strong background in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, I‚Äôm always expanding my skills to stay at the forefront of the field.

Before transitioning into data analytics, I spent over a decade as a teacher, where I developed a passion for making learning engaging and accessible. This experience has shaped my approach to data: breaking down complex concepts into understandable and actionable insights.

This project is, if I‚Äôm being honest, something I initially wanted for my own use. As an avid listener of contemporary music, I love evaluating and experiencing today‚Äôs best music, often attending concerts to immerse myself in the artistry. But beyond my personal interest, this project became a fascinating exploration of how machine learning can use past behavior to predict future preferences. It‚Äôs not about tracking listeners; it‚Äôs about understanding patterns and applying them to create better, more personalized experiences. This approach has broad applications, from music to e-commerce to customer segmentation, and it‚Äôs a powerful tool for any business looking to anticipate and meet customer needs.

The goal of this project is to predict my music preferences and recommend new albums from Spotify's "New Music Friday" playlist. The model uses a combination of regression techniques, network analysis, and feature engineering to make personalized recommendations. Key features include:

- **Artist Centrality**: Measures how central an artist is to my music taste using PageRank.
- **Genre Encoding**: Encodes genres based on their relevance to my preferences.
- **Mood Score**: Combines valence, danceability, and liveness to capture the vibe of a track.
- **Energy Profile**: Combines energy, loudness, and tempo to gauge the intensity of a track.

## Features

The model uses the following features to make predictions:

1. **Popularity**: The popularity score of the track (0-100).
2. **Genres_encoded**: Target-encoded genres based on my preferences.
3. **Artist Centrality**: A score representing how central an artist is to my music taste.
4. **Label_Category_encoded**: Target-encoded record label categories (Large, Medium, Small, Unknown/DIY).
5. **Mood Score**: A combination of valence, danceability, and liveness.
6. **Energy Profile**: A combination of energy, loudness, and tempo.
7. **Featured_Centrality_Score**: A score representing the centrality of featured artists.
